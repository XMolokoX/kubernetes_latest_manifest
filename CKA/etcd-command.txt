For example ETCDCTL version 2 supports the following commands:

etcdctl backup
etcdctl cluster-health
etcdctl mk
etcdctl mkdir
etcdctl set


Whereas the commands are different in version 3

etcdctl snapshot save 
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl get
etcdctl put

To set the right version of API set the environment variable ETCDCTL_API command

export ETCDCTL_API=3

The certificate files are available in the etcd-master at the following path. We discuss more about certificates in the security section of this course. So don't worry if this looks complex:

--cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt     
--cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt     
--key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
